# Learn-Pyro

### Introduction
Hi, I'm a graduate student from VLLAB in NTHU (National Tsing Hua University).
In 2018 spring, professor HT CHEN asked his lab students to spend some time studying [Pyro](http://pyro.ai/).

What is pyro? It isï¼š
+ A Deep Universal Probabilistic Programming Language

In the half year from now (2018.4.11), I will upload codes about Pyro (mainly example codes from official website) to make sure that I have done these exercises.

### Schedule
1. Walk through basic examples [Here](http://pyro.ai/examples/).
2. Try to implement on some mini projects, using our own real dataset to solve problems.
3. (uncertain) Maybe our lab will produce teaching videos to explain examples on official website.
